# Bank-customer-analysis

Project Description:

The Banking Intelligence company wants to develop a supervised machine learning model to predict future behaviors of its customers, based on transactional data and product ownership characteristics. The aim of the project is to create a denormalized table with a set of indicators (features) derived from the tables available in the database, representing the behaviors and financial activities of customers.

Goal:

Our goal is to create a feature table for training machine learning models, enriching customer data with various indicators calculated from their transactions and accounts held. The final table will be referred to the customer ID and will contain both quantitative and qualitative information.
